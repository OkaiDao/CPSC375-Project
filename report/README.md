![our first graph](https://github.com/OkaiDao/CPSC375-Project/raw/main/images/vac_data.png)

This graph currently shows the vaccination rate of covid-19 based on different countries since the date in which the country started the vaccine.  Currently, we are not tracking gross domestic product in this graph, although we believe that once we have created some models we might see some interesting relationships between the rate at which the public has been vaccinated give the GDP of that country.
